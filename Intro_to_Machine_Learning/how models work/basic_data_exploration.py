#Step 1: Loading Data
import pandas as pd
# Path of the file to read
iowa_file_path = '../input/home-data-for-ml-course/train.csv'
# Fill in the line below to read the
# file into a variable home_data
home_data = pd.read_csv(iowa_file_path)


#Step 2: Review The Data
# What is the average lot size
# (rounded to nearest integer)?
avg_lot_size = round(10516.828082)
# As of today, how old is the newest home
#(current year - the date in which it was built)
newest_home_age = 2026 - 2010
